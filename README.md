## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later
- **Software:**
  - [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) installed
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed with necessary extensions

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up your development environment.

### 1. Install Anaconda and VS Code

- **Anaconda:** Download and install Anaconda from the [official website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** Download and install VS Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- **VS Code Extensions:** Install the following recommended extensions for Python development:
  - Python
  - Pylance
  - Jupyter
  - GitLens

### 2. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
Replace your-username and your-repository with your GitHub username and the repository name respectively.

3. Set Up the Conda Environment
Initialize Conda for PowerShell
Open Anaconda PowerShell Prompt from the Start menu.

Initialize Conda for PowerShell by running:

Powershell

conda init powershell

Restart your PowerShell to apply the changes.

Set Execution Policy
Open PowerShell with administrative privileges.

Set the execution policy to allow scripts to run:

Powershell

Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

When prompted, type Y and press Enter to confirm.
Create the Conda Environment
Navigate to your project directory and create a new Conda environment with Python 3.10:

Powershell

conda create -p venv python=3.10
-p venv specifies the path to the environment. This will create a folder named venv in your project directory.

Activate the Environment
Activate the newly created Conda environment:

conda activate .\venv\
Your terminal prompt should now indicate that the venv environment is active.

4. Install Dependencies
Create a requirements.txt File:

In your project directory, create a file named requirements.txt and add the necessary libraries:

Copy in plaintext:

scikit-learn
pandas

Add any additional libraries your project requires.

Install the Libraries:

With the Conda environment activated, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This command installs all the libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.

Usage
Provide instructions and examples on how to use your project.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:

Fork the repository.

Create a new branch:

git checkout -b feature/YourFeature
Make your changes and commit them:

git commit -m "Add YourFeature"
Push to the branch:

git push origin feature/YourFeature
Open a pull request.

License
Specify the license under which your project is distributed. For example:
